    <h1>Web Workers Demo: The Basics</h1>

    <h3>1.Advantages: run expensive operations in isolated thread without interrupting main thread</h3>
    <h4>deal with normal expensive data</h4>
    <h4>image processing</h4>
    <h4>lazy loading</h4>
    <h4>canvas paint and render</h4>
    <h4>MVVM mode, data-driven development, deal with big data in front end</h4>

    <h3>2.Disadvantages: Worker thread can not access the DOM or the parent page,
        Worker thread can only communicate through postMessage()
    </h3>
    <h3>Same origin limitation</h3>

    <h3>4.Basic Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            You create a web worker(two types: Worker and SharedWorker).
        </li>
        <li>
            You tell the web worker what to do. (For example, crunch these numbers!)
        </li>
        <li>
            You start the web worker.
        </li>
        <li>
            When the web worker is done, it tells you, and your code goes from there. (For example, show the results on your page.)
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>5.How to stop</h3>
    <p>
        There are two ways to stop a worker. First, a worker can stop itself by calling close(). 
        More commonly,the page that created the worker will shut it down by calling the workerâ€™s terminate() method.

    <h3>7.a way to create inline worker instead of creating a new URi file in the folder, and better for webpack packaging</h3>
    <code>var blob = new Blob([myTask]);
        var myWorker = new Worker(window.URL.createObjectURL(blob));</code>
